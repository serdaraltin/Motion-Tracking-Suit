## 24. Troubleshooting

If you face any challenges while setting up or using the Motion Tracking Suit project, refer to this troubleshooting guide for common issues and solutions:

### 24.1 Arduino Connection Issues

- **Issue:** Arduino does not establish a Wi-Fi connection.
  - **Solution:** Double-check the Wi-Fi credentials in the Arduino code to ensure they match your network. Also, verify that your Wi-Fi router is functioning correctly.

### 24.2 Sensor Calibration Problems

- **Issue:** Motion data appears inaccurate or unstable.
  - **Solution:** Calibrate the MPU6050 and HMC5883L sensors as described in section 3.4 of this documentation. Proper calibration improves the accuracy of motion tracking.

### 24.3 Real-Time Performance Problems

- **Issue:** Motion visualization in Blender lags or freezes.
  - **Solution:** Ensure that your hardware meets the recommended specifications for smooth real-time performance. Consider optimizing your network connection and reducing network latency.

### 24.4 Plugin Compatibility Issues

- **Issue:** The Blender plugin is not working as expected or causing errors.
  - **Solution:** Make sure you are using Blender version 3.40.0 or later, as the plugin may not be compatible with older versions. Check for any error messages in the Blender console and refer to the [project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/yourusername/motion-tracking-suit) for updates or patches.

## 25. Roadmap and Future Developments

The Motion Tracking Suit project is an ongoing endeavor, and we have exciting plans for its future development. Here are some of the upcoming features and improvements we aim to implement:

- **Support for Additional Sensors:** We intend to extend sensor compatibility to include other popular motion sensors, such as BNO055 and MPU9250.

- **Enhanced User Interface:** We aim to improve the user interface in the Blender plugin with more customization options for motion visualization.

- **Mobile App Integration:** We plan to develop a mobile app to control the motion tracking and visualize data remotely.

- **Community Contributions:** We encourage the community to contribute new features, bug fixes, and documentation enhancements. We will actively review and integrate community contributions to make the project even better.
