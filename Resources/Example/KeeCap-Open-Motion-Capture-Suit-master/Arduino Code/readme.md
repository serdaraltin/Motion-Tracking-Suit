This folder contains all of the arduino code for putting in the arduino for the motion capture suit.

Unpack the MotionCaptureArduinoLibraries.zip into your Arduino Libraries folder.  then open the INO file and upload it into your Arduino Mega.

# Ignore Everything Below!!!! I tried to install all these from the web recently and the current libraries are no longer compatible with the code!!!  I packed up the libraries that work into a zip and included it in the repo so future generations will always be able to build the code.

To run the above code you need to put the following libraries into your arduino environment:

# Adafruit Unified BNO055 Driver (AHRS/Orientation) #

https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor

download the files from the above link and unpack the Adafruit_Sensor-Master folder into your Arduino/libraries folder.  Delete the -master from the folder name.

https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BNO055

download the files from the above link and unpack the Adafruit_Sensor-Master folder into your Arduino/libraries folder.  Delete the -master from the folder name.

# Adafruit Data logging shield

for more information on the shield view this: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-data-logger-shield/overview

use the above link to install the sd card and real time clock libraries, but in short download this:
https://github.com/adafruit/SD/archive/master.zip

download the files from the above link and unpack the SD-Master folder into your Arduino/libraries folder.  Delete the -master from the folder name.

also download this:

https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib

download the files from the above link and unpack the RTClib-Master folder into your Arduino/libraries folder.  Delete the -master from the folder name.

# Liquid Menu and LIquid Crystal from here:
https://github.com/arduino-libraries/LiquidCrystal
download the files from the above link and unpack the LiquidCrystal-Master folder into your Arduino/libraries folder.  Delete the -master from the folder name.


download the files from the above link and unpack the LiquidCristal-Master folder into your Arduino/libraries folder.  Delete the -master from the folder name.
